# YouTube-Music
This is a YouTube Music user review sentiment analysis project.
Over 9000 words are captured in this 1 star review of YouTube Music users' review. 118 reviews are captured in this text file.
From the result of the analysis, it appears the major concerns of the users with these 1 star review is their inability to play the songs they want.
It also appears they are unable to create their own playlists. The music shuffle is not enjoyable to them.
However, it seems there is a premium version that allows for better customization.
